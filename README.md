This is an Arithmetic Expression Parser program written in C language. The program prompts the user to enter the variables' names and numbers, and analyzes each given arithmetic phrase to see if it follows a predetermined grammar. For each input expression, it builds a parse tree and verifies that the operators and operands are arranged correctly in accordance with the rules specified for expressions ('addsub'), terms ('muldiv'), and factors ('var'). It outputs "Accepted" if the expression is valid and "Rejected" otherwise. In order to handle variable names, the program uses dynamic memory allocation. It also makes sure that memory management is done correctly by freeing up allocated memory after use.
